action2031000=Contact technical support
messagedetail2031001=The Activation of Split-Join resources could not be committed because the deployment session has already been closed. This is an invalid state that could be the result of other session (WLS, OSB) related issues.
action2031001=The deployment session has not been committed and the server may be in an inconsistent state. If the OSB session has been activated, try to undo and retry the activation. If the problem persists, restarting the server should unlock the sessions. Contact technical support.

messagedetail2031100=An error occured trying to un-marshall the response of a service invocation. A generic fault will be raise in the Split-Join.
action2031100=Turn on transport level debug log to get more information regarding the response message. If the service being invoked is a proxy service, turning on tracing for that service may also provide more information on the message.

messagedetail2031102=An error occured trying to marshall the fault response into a SOAP Fault. The fault response was processed as if this error did not occur. If an error handler was configured in the calling Split-Join for this fault, and a SOAP Fault variable was defined, then its content will be empty.

messagedetail2031300=The transformation (most probably an assign or replace in that case) did not return any value.
action2031300=Turn on tracing to check the data. Check the data expression for the given transformation. An empty result may be due to missing XML elements/attributes in the data, improper use of namespaces...
messagedetail2031301=The transformation (most probably an assign or replace in that case) returned more than one value.
action2031301=Turn on tracing to check the data. Check the data expression for the given transformation. Such result may happen for example if the selected XML elements/attributes correspond to repeating nodes (XML Schema maxOccurs > 1).

action2031330=Check the value of the variable that is targeted for insert operation.
messagedetail2031331=The Insert is configured to insert before/after the result of the selection, but the result of the selection is the variable itself.
action2031331=Check the XPath expression of the Insert action. The XPath expression should not result in the selection of the variable itself (e.g. ".[0]").
messagedetail2031332=Inserting the result of this expression after specified XPath resulted in an error.

messagedetail2031351=The parameter expression returned a simple type value instead of an XML fragment.
action2031351=Check the data expression for the given parameter. An XML fragment is expected but a simple type is returned.
## P4ADE ## {0} : String method, {1} : int index, {2} : String msg, {3} : Throwable t
messagedetail2031352=A NumberFormatException was raised for parameter at index {1} in method \"{0}\" during the conversion from the simple type result to the expected java type.
