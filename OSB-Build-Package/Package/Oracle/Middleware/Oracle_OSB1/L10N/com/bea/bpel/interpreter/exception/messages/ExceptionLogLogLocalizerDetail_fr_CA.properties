messagedetail2031500=The inbound message has been rejected because it matches more than 1 enabled inbound messaging activity with the same partner link and operation but different correlation sets. It cannot be determined which inbound messaging activity the message should be delivered to. This is potentially due to a timing issue. See WS-BPEL 2.0, section 10.4 for more detail.
messagedetail2031501=The counter will never complete. See WS-BPEL 2.0, section 11.7 for more detail.
action2031501=Revise the counter so that it can complete.
messagedetail2031502=A receive activity was processed that, if successfully enabled, would have resulted in more than 1 receive waiting for the same message. If more than 1 receive is enabled for the same partner link, operation and correlation set it would result in multiple targets for inbound messages. This is potentially due to a timing issue. See WS-BPEL 2.0, section 10.4 for more detail.
messagedetail2031503=It is illegal to have more than 1 inbound messaging activity enabled with the same partner link, operation and message exchange token. See WS-BPEL 2.0, section 10.4.1 for more detail.
messagedetail2031504=The counter has processed to the point where it will never complete (For example, the counter may require 8 more iterations but there will only be 6). See WS-BPEL 2.0, section 11.7 for more detail.
messagedetail2031505=A join condition of a branch of a flow has evaluated to false. See WS-BPEL 2.0, section 11.6.2 for more detail.
messagedetail2031506=An expression evaluated to an incompatible type for assignment. See WS-BPEL 2.0, sections 8.4.2 and 8.4.3 for more detail.
messagedetail2031507=The partner link for an outstanding message exchange has just gone out of scope so the exchange will never be replied to. See WS-BPEL 2.0, section 10.4.1 for more detail.
messagedetail2031508=An attempt was made to reply to a non-existent message exchange. See WS-BPEL 2.0, section 10.4.1 for more detail.
messagedetail2031509=An unexpected error occurred while executing an expression. The exception message should provide details of the cause.
action2031509=Correct the error specified in the exception message.
messagedetail2031510=An attempt was made to access a partner link before it was initialized. This should never happen (it should be caught by validation during deployment).
action2031510=Contact Technical Support.
messagedetail2031511=The source for the doXslTransform function contains an XML document with other than 1 root node.
action2031511=Ensure that the source contains only 1 root node.
messagedetail2031512=The source for doXslTransform is an unsupported type. This should never happen.
action2031512=Contact Technical Support.
messagedetail2031513=The XSL stylesheet could not be found on the class loader hierarchy.
action2031513=Ensure that the stylesheet can be found on the class loader hierarchy.
messagedetail2031514=A message was received by the process for a partner link, operation and correlation sets when one is already waiting to be processed. One possible reason for this is that the messages were received out of order.
action2031514=Resend the message.
messagedetail2031515=The EII selected by the from-spec is not substitutable for the EII selected by the to-spec. If the from-spec and the to-spec select EIIs with different element names, then the from-spec element must belong to the substitutionGroup of the to-spec element (as determined by the schema definitions for the elements).
messagedetail2031516=A process instance could not be found. This generally happens when a ForEach is used with a completion condition.
action2031516=If this is not expected, contact Technical Support.
messagedetail2031517=The link is being referenced before it has been set. This is generally a problem with the process definition but it could be a timing issue.
action2031517=Modify the process to ensure that the link is always set before it is referenced.
messagedetail2031518=The variable is being referenced before it has been initialized. This is generally a problem with the process definition but it could be a timing issue.
action2031518=Modify the process to ensure that the variable is always initialized before it is referenced.
messagedetail2031519=The inbound message is missing at least one part.
action2031519=Ensure that the message contains all the parts defined on the message type for the input message of the operation.
messagedetail2031520=The outbound message is missing at least one part.
action2031520=Ensure that the message contains all the parts defined on the message type for the output message of the operation.
messagedetail2031521=Expressions (particularly those used in Copy) should return a single item. If the expression evaluates to 0 or more than 1 item it is an exception.
action2031521=Ensure that the expression selects a single item.
messagedetail2031522=An attempt was made to start a new transaction when one was already active. This is not supported. This should never happen (because transactions cannot be explicitly started currently).
action2031522=Contact Technical Support.
