messagedetail2031600=The correlation set has an invalid value. This should never happen.
action2031600=Contact Technical Support.
messagedetail2031601=The inbound message does not match a start activity and it contains no correlation properties. As such, it will never be able to be delivered to a process instance.
action2031601=Either modify the message so it will correlate (different process, partner link, operation or correlation properties) or modify the process.
messagedetail2031602=There are no inbound message activities for the partner link and operation of the message. The message cannot be delivered to any instance of the given process.
action2031602=Either modify the message so it does match an inbound messaging activity (different process, partner link or operation) or modify the process to match the message.
messagedetail2031603=While correlating the incoming message, some messaging activities were found but after ranking them, there was no "best" match selected. This should never happen.
action2031603=Contact Technical Support.
messagedetail2031604=While correlating the incoming message, a specific process instance was selected but there were no messaging activities for the partner link and operation. This should never happen.
action2031604=Contact Technical Support.
messagedetail2031605=The incoming message correlates to multiple process instances. This means that there was more than 1 process instance to which the message could be delivered.
action2031605=Either modify the message so it only matches one process instance (different process, partner link, operation or correlation properties) or modify the process.
messagedetail2031606=The incoming message correlates to multiple start activities in the process instance. This means the message cannot be delivered. This is a problem with the process definition.
action2031606=Modify the process definition to define only a single start activity for the same partner link and operation.
messagedetail2031607=A correlation set that has an initiate value of "NO" has not been initiated. An initiate value of "NO" means that the correlation set should already be initiated before being used to correlate an inbound message.
action2031607=Modify the process to ensure that all correlation sets are initiated before they are used.
messagedetail2031608=A correlation set that has an initiate value of "YES" has already been initiated. An initiate value of "YES" means that the correlation set should NOT be initiated as it will be initiated using the values of the inbound message.
action2031608=Modify the process to ensure that correlation sets are NOT initiated before they should be.
messagedetail2031609=A message that has already been matched to a messaging activity has different correlation properties than the correlation set values associated to the messaging activity. This generally occurs for outbound messages (since the inbound messages wouldn't have matched this instance if they didn't match).
action2031609=Ensure that the outbound message has the same correlation properties as the messaging activity.
messagedetail2031610=While correlating the incoming message, message properties were calculated but did not match any existing process instance. It is possible that this message will match a process instance in the future.
action2031610=Resend the message.
