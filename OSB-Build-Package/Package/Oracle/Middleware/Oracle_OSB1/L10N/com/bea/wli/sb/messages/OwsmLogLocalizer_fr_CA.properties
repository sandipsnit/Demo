## P4ADE ## {0} : String policyID
messagebody387197=The service has OWSM Transport Policy ''{0}'' with transport security enabled but HTTPS is not enabled on this service. This combination is not supported. Please enable ''HTTPS Required'' on transport configuration page OR disable transport security on the OWSM policy.
