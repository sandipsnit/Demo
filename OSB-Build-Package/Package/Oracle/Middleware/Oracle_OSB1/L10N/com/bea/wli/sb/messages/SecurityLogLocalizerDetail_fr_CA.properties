messagedetail386041=In older release of ALSB (2.0 and 2.1), ALSB did not include the password to service key provider key-pair credentials in exported configuration jar files. When such a service key provider is later imported into subsequent releases, OSB expects the key-pair binding to already be present in the PKI Credential Mapper Provider. To do that, you would export the PKI Credential Mapper Provider data from your previous domain and import it into your new domain. NOTE: It is recommended that you instead re-configure this service key provider credentials, that way OSB will keep an encrypted copy of the key-pair's password and this error will not happen again
