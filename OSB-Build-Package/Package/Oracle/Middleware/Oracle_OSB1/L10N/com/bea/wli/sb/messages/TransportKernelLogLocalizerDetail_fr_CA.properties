messagedetail380000=A generic runtime error has occured in OSB transport subsystem while processing the message. There should be a specific message that describes specific cause of the problem. This error typically occurs when an exception is thrown during the outbound call, but it can also be explicitly raised by the outbound transport implementation, in which case, it may have a customized the message associated with it.
action380000=If this is an unexpected error happening on a customized transport, check for unchecked exceptions in outbound call implementation. For other transports, check the documentation corresponding to this error code. Contact technical support when this is an OSB runtime internal error.
messagedetail380001=An application error has occured in OSB transport subsystem while processing the message. There should be a specific message that describes specific cause of the problem. Only transports that explicitly declare support for application errors can return such errors. This error is explicitly raised by the transport implementation and usually has a customized message associated with it. It is used by OSB to prevent unnecessary retries.
action380001=Check in the transport documentation describing application errors.
messagedetail380002=A connection error has occured in OSB transport subsystem while processing the message. There should be a specific message that describes specific cause of the problem. This error is raised by the transport implementation and usually has a customized message associated with it. It is used by OSB to put a URI offline.
action380002=Check in the transport documentation describing connection errors.
messagedetail380003=An unexpected runtime error has occured in OSB transport subsystem while processing the message. There should be a specific message that describes specific cause of the problem
action380003=Contact technical support
messagedetail380004=The processing of the response message has failed in OSB transport subsystem due to the fact that the configuration for the business service is in flux. This service is unable to send an outbound message until the configuration stabilizes.
action380004=Wait until the configuration of OSB server stabilizes and retry sending the request.
messagedetail380005=An error has occured while transforming the message payload from one type (e.g. MFL) to another (e.g. XML). This may happen some transport requires the payload in certain form in order to send an outbound request and OSB runtime has no way to convert payload in its current form to desired form
action380005=Contact technical support
messagedetail380006=There is no transport provider deployed on the OSB server for the specified ID
action380006=Verify that the transport provider application for that specified ID was correctly deployed on the OSB server. If this happens during server start up, it is also possible that the transport is registered too late. If so, try lowering its deployment order.
messagedetail380008=The transport provider configuration does not support inbound endpoints, but somehow the configuration framework tried to create or update an inbound endpoint for that provider
action380008=If this is a custom provider, verify that transport provider XML configuration is consistent with the generated endpoint configuration. Otherwise, contact technical support
messagedetail380009=The transport provider configuration does not support outbound endpoints, but somehow the configuration framework tried to create or update an outbound endpoint for that provider
action380009=If this is a custom provider, verify that the transport provider XML configuration is consistent with the generated endpoint configuration. Otherwise, contact technical support
messagedetail380010=The provider for that endpoint declares a provider specific XML Schema Type but the endpoint configuration contains no provider specific configuration
action380010=If this is a custom provider, verify that the provider specific definition is correctly set in the implementation. Otherwise, contact technical support
messagedetail380011=The endpoint configuration contains a provider specific configuration but the provider for that endpoint does not declare any provider specific XML Schema Type
action380011=If this is a custom provider, check that its implementation returns the appropriate schema type corresponding to the provider specific configuration. Otherwise, contact technical support
action380012=If this is a custom provider, verify the proxy service configuration is correctly initialized. Otherwise, contact technical support
action380013=If this is a custom provider, verify the business service configuration is correctly initialized. Otherwise, contact technical support
messagedetail380014=The endpoint supports application errors but the provider for that endpoint does not
action380014=If this is a custom provider, verify that transport provider XML configuration is consistent with the generated endpoint configuration. Otherwise, contact technical support
messagedetail380015=This error happens during configuration update: the URI of one of the updated Business Service is already used
action380015=Delete Business Service or use a different URI
messagedetail380016=The Business service is configured to put URIs offline upon connection errors and there is no online URIs left to route messages sent to this service
action380016=Check the service configuration and the server connections
messagedetail380017=The transport provider configuration xml file is either syntactically or semantically incorrect. The message body should include the error description and the invalid XML snippet
action380017=Correct the configuration
## P4ADE ## {0} : String scheme
messagedetail380018=The configured service type is not supported by the transport ({0}).
action380018=If you are trying to import a config jar, your service definition is corrupted, or the current OSB version no longer support the binding defined in the config jar, re-create the service with the new supported binding. For any other reasons, contact technical support.
## P4ADE ## {0} : String ref
cause380019=The service transport configuration is in flux: ({0}).
action380019=If you modified your service transport configuration, messages received after the change is committed will be processed normally. For any other reasons, contact Oracle Support Services.
## P4ADE ## {0} : String ref
cause380020=The service ({0}) has been disabled.
action380020=Enable the service, messages received after the change is committed will be processed normally. For any other reasons, contact Oracle Support Services.
messagedetail380100=Business service is throttled and rejected the message because the service reached its maximum concurrency limit and has no throttling queue to backlog messages
action380100=In the throttling settings for this business service, either disable throttling, set a maximum queue length that is greater than zero, or increase the maximum concurrency
messagedetail380101=The message was sent to a throttled business service and expired in its throttling queue after the specified time-to-live while waiting for the service to become available
action380101=In the throttling settings for this business service, either disable throttling, set a longer the time-to-live (you can set it to zero for an unlimited time-to-live), or increase the maximum concurrency
messagedetail380102=The message was sent to a throttled business service and was rejected by its throttling queue. The queue may be full and the message priority lesser than the messages already in the queue; or the queue was resized or the service renamed while the message was waiting in the queue.
action380102=In the routing options, increase the priority of the messages sent to this business service, or, in the throttling settings for this business service, either disable throttling, increase the maximum concurrency or increase the maximum queue length
messagedetail380103=An internal error occurred in the throttling sub-system. The message body should include the throttled service on which the error occurred and the message describing the problem: this error can be due to a transactional error, interrupted thread exception, timeout or an invalid runtime state
action380103=If this is due to an invalid runtime state, contact technical support
