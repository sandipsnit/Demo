## P4ADE ## {0} : String inboundEndpoint
messagedetail381316=An identity asserter with X.509 token support enabled is required because HTTPS inbound endpoint {0} specifies CLIENT-CERT authentication
action381316=Enable X.509 identity assertion in your Identity Assertion provider in the security realm pages of the WebLogic Server console
## P4ADE ## {0} : String inboundEndpoint
messagedetail381317=HTTPS inbound endpoint {0} specifies CLIENT-CERT authentication, therefore the username mapper properties of the default identity asserter must be configured (this is required to support 2-way SSL)
action381317=Configure the username-mapper fields of the Default Identity Assertion provider in the security realm pages of the WebLogic Server console
messagedetail381318=An error had occured while registering a new HTTP proxy service: The URI configured for this proxy service is already used by another HTTP proxy service or WS proxy service. Each HTTP proxy service has to have a unique URI.
action381318=Check the transport configuration for HTTP proxy service and make sure that unique value for the URI is used.
messagedetail381319=An error had occured while registering a new HTTP business service: One of the URLs configured for the business service is invalid. According to RFC 2616, HTTP urls must start with http:// and have a hostname
action381319=Check the transport configuration for HTTP business service and make sure that a valid URL is being entered
messagedetail381320=An error had occured while registering a new HTTP proxy service: The URI configured for this proxy service is an absolute URI. Only relative URIs are supported for HTTP proxy services.
action381320=Check the transport configuration for HTTP proxy service and make sure that only a relative URI (e.g. "/someName") is used.
messagedetail381321=An error had occured while registering a new HTTP proxy service: The URI configured for this proxy service "/" is already used internal OSB Kernel application.
action381321=Check the transport configuration for HTTP proxy service and make sure that a different unique value is used for the URI of this proxy
messagedetail381322=There was a problem while setting specified header name/value pair in outbound HTTP request or inbound response. HTTP transport only allows String header values while another data type was given. One way it could happen is when using transport header action to pass all transport headers through from one transport that supports non-String headers, such as JMS, to HTTP transport
action381322=Check the pipeline configuration to make sure only Strings are used to set transport header values of HTTP outbound request or inbound response
messagedetail381323=The proxy service is configured for client-certificate authentication but it is not an https endpoint. Client-certificate authentication is only allowed over https endpoints
action381323=Set the https-required flag to true in the transport configuration page
messagedetail381324=The HTTP transport configuration of this outbound endpoint specifies custom-token authentication. This is not supported in this Oracle Service Bus release
action381324=Change the authentication method in the endpoint configuration page
## P4ADE ## {0} : String tokenType
messagedetail381325=This endpoint is configured with transport-level custom token authentication for tokens of type "{0}". There is no Identity Assertion Provider for this token type or the token type has not been activated
## P4ADE ## {0} : String tokenType
action381325=Go to the security realm pages in the WebLogic Server console to make sure your security realm has an Identity Assertion Provider which supports tokens of type "{0}"; also make sure the token type is in the provider's list of enabled tokens
messagedetail381326=Transport-level custom token authentication requires you to specify the name of the HTTP header that will carry the token
action381326=Edit the http endpoint configuration details and specify the name of the custom token http header
messagedetail381331=The endpoint is configured for custom token authentication. A token-type must be specified
cause381331=The token-type is null or empty
action381331=In the HTTP transport-specific configuration page, choose a token-type from the drop-down list or select a different authentication method
messagedetail381332=The endpoint is configured for custom token authentication. The name of the HTTP header which carries the custom token must be specified
cause381332=The header-name is null or empty
action381332=In the HTTP transport-specific configuration page, enter the name of the HTTP header or select a different authentication method
action381333=Check the transport configuration for HTTP business service and make sure that a valid HTTP method name is being entered.
action381334=Check the transport configuration for HTTP business service and make sure that a valid HTTP method name is being entered.
action381335=Check the transport configuration for HTTP business service and make sure that a valid HTTP method name is being entered.
action381336=Check the transport configuration for HTTP business service and make sure that URI set should not be empty.
action381337=Check the transport configuration for HTTP business service and make sure that both ''chunked streaming mode'' and ''follow HTTP redirects'' options are not enabled.
action381338=Rejecting a non HTTP POST request due to WS-I compliance rules. User should send a POST request to the service.
