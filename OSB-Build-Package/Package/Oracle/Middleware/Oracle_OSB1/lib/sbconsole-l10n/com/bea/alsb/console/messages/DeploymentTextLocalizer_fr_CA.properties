VIEW_EXPORT_REPS_TITLE=Export Resources
VIEW_EXPORT_REPS_DESCRIPTION=This page lists all the resources that can be exported to a file. Select one or more resources, then click Export. You can subsequently use the file to import the configuration into another instance of Oracle Service Bus.
TASK_EXPORT_CONFIG_DATA=Export Resources
TASK_UPGRADE_EXPORT_JAR=Upgrade Export File
VIEW_CONFIG_CHANGES_TITLE=View Configuration Changes
VIEW_CONFIG_CHANGES_DESC=This page lists all configuration changes made so far in the current user's session. You can view the status of tasks and undo tasks.
VIEW_CONFIG_CHANGES_DESC_NOT_IN_SESSION=This page lists all configuration changes made by all users. You can view the status of tasks and undo tasks.
TASK_VIEW_CHANGES=View Changes
VIEW_IMPORT_REPS_TITLE=Import Resources
VIEW_IMPORT_REPS_DESCRIPTION=This page displays the Oracle Service Bus configuration data that are going to be imported. You can choose to import all or a subset of the configuration data.
TASK_IMPORT_CONFIG_DATA=Import Resources
VIEW_DEPLOYMENT_HISTORY_TITLE=View Deployment History
VIEW_DEPLOYMENT_HISTORY_DESCRIPTION=This page displays the resources that are already deployed and the status of the deployment.
TASK_DEPLOYMENT_HISTORY=Deployment History
REVIEW_DEPLOYMENT_TITLE=Review Deployment
REVIEW_DEPLOYMENT_DESC=Review the items that will be deployed.
VIEW_DEPLOYMENT_RESULT_TITLE=View Deployment Results
VIEW_DEPLOYMENT_RESULT_DESC=Use this page to review the results of a deployment.
CREATE_EXPORT_REP_BANNER_TITLE=Create a New Export Repository
CREATE_EXPORT_REP_BANNER_DESC=To create a new export repository, enter a name for the repository.
EXISTING_EXPORT_REP_BANNER_TITLE=Work on an Existing Export Repository
EXISTING_EXPORT_REP_BANNER_DESC=You can modify an existing repository by adding, removing, or modifying the configuration data contained therein.\n\n 		When you are ready to export the configuration data in a given repository, create a file. You can subsequently import that file	and deploy the configuration to another Oracle Service Bus domain.
WORK_ON_NEW_IMPORT_REP_BANNER_TITLE=Work on a New Import Repository
WORK_ON_NEW_IMPORT_REP_BANNER_DESC=Locate the file to import to create this repository.
WORK_ON_EXISTING_IMPORT_REP_BANNER_TITLE=Work on an Existing Import Repository
WORK_ON_EXISTING_IMPORT_REP_BANNER_DESC=You can choose to import all or a subset of the configuration data in a given repository. You can change the values of certain configuration data. After you import a given configuration and optionally modify the data, you must deploy the configuration.
DEFINE_MAPPING_BANNER_TITLE=Define Mapping
DEFINE_MAPPING_BANNER_DESC=If an item that is included in your imported configuration references one or more other items that are either not included in the imported configuration, or for which an equivalent item does not exist in the current domain, you must map the referenced item to an existing item in the current domain. A mapping can become invalid if the item that is referenced by the mapping target is deleted from the domain.
VIEW_EXPORTED_ITEMS_BANNER_TITLE=Items Marked for Export
VIEW_EXPORTED_ITEMS_BANNER_DESC=This page lists items that are selected for export. Exported items are stored in an export repository. Use this page to view the dependencies, synchronize items if the source has been updated, or remove items from the export repository.\n\n 	 The data in a repository is not updated or deleted automatically when the corresponding item in the domain is updated or deleted. You can synchronize the data in an export repository with the data in the domain by explicitly synchronizing or deleting items.
VIEW_NONEXPORTED_ITEMS_BANNER_TITLE=Items Not Marked for Export
VIEW_NONEXPORTED_ITEMS_BANNER_DESC=This page shows items that are currently not selected for export. You can use this page to modify the current repository by selecting single or multiple items for export. Then click Done to return to the page from which you can create the file that includes all the items that you selected for export.
VIEW_INCLUDED_IMPORTS_BANNER_TITLE=Items Marked for Deployment
VIEW_INCLUDED_IMPORTS_BANNER_DESC=This page shows the items that are currently selected for deployment. By default, all the items in an imported file are selected for deployment, but you can select specific items to exclude. When you import a repository, if an item does not exist in the current domain, it is created. If an item does exist, it is updated. No items in the current domain are deleted as a result of a deployment.
VIEW_EXCLUDED_IMPORTS_BANNER_TITLE=Items Excluded from Deployment
VIEW_EXCLUDED_IMPORTS_BANNER_DESC=This page lists items that were included in the exported file, but excluded from deployment. You can exclude an item if it is not required, or if an equivalent item already exists in the current domain (and you do not want to overwrite it). Deployment fails if you exclude items that are referenced and required by other items. To avoid a failed deployment, either map the excluded items to another item that exists in the current domain, or explicitly create an equivalent item in the current domain.
VIEW_MISSING_IMPORTS_BANNER_TITLE=Missing Items
VIEW_MISSING_IMPORTS_BANNER_DESC=This page lists items that are referenced in the imported file, but that are not present in the exported file or in the current domain. To proceed with the deployment, you must map these references to items that exist in the current domain, or create an equivalent item in the current domain.
VIEW_ENV_VALUES_BANNER_TITLE=Environment Dependent Values
VIEW_ENV_VALUES_BANNER_DESC=This page displays the environment-dependent values that are associated with a resource in the configuration. You can override the original values before deploying the resource.
VIEW_ENV_VALUES1_BANNER_TITLE=Environment Values
VIEW_ENV_VALUES1_BANNER_DESC=This page displays the environment-dependent properties of an exported item. You can optionally associate one or more properties with a variable, remove an association, and change properties automatically by assigning values to variables during deployment.
ASSIGN_VARIABLE_VALUES_BANNER_TITLE=View and Assign Deployment Variables
ASSIGN_VARIABLE_VALUES_BANNER_DESC=Use this page to view and edit the values of the deployment variables. Deployment variables allow you to change the values of environment-dependent parameters by associating the parameters with a variable and subsequently assigning a value for that variable.
UPGRADE_EXPORT_JAR_TITLE=Upgrade an Exported File
VIEW_REFERENCES_BANNER_TITLE=View References
BANNER_DESC_VIEW_UNRESOLVED_REFS=This page lists items that are required by an item that is selected for deployment. A referenced item is required if an equivalent item is not already deployed in the current domain or if it is not explicitly mapped to an existing item. Deployment fails if there are unresolved references. To avoid a failed deployment, you must map the referenced item to an existing item in the current domain, or explicitly create the referenced item in the current domain.
BANNER_DESC_VIEW_NONEXPORTED_CHILDREN=This page lists items that are not exported, but upon which an exported item depends. Typically, you export all dependencies. However, you can choose not to export the dependencies if you know that the target domain contains the excluded items, or if you plan to map the excluded items to other items existing in the target domain during the import process.
BANNER_DESC_VIEW_EXPORTED_PARENTS=This page lists exported items that depend on an item that was not exported.
BANNER_DESC_VIEW_PARENTS_THAT_REQUIRE_THIS=This page lists the parents of an excluded or missing item that is required for deployment. An item is required if another item currently selected for import references it, and there is no equivalent item in the current domain.
