messagedetail381901=An unexpected general purpose exception has occurred in OSB MQ transport. There should be an error message that points to cause of the problem
action381901=Contact technical support
messagedetail381902=The MQ cleanup thread has picked up a message from configured MQ response destination that did not have expected CorrelationID message property. As a result, the response message was dropped.
action381902=Make sure that the back-end MQ business service is properly functioning (e.g. that the CorrelationID is being echoed when responding).
cause381903=The MQ cleanup thread has picked up a message from configured MQ response destination that did not have expected CorrelationID message property. Such messages are routed to the 'Unrecognized Message URI'; if the URI is not configured, the messages are dropped.
action381903=Please configure 'Unrecognized Message URI' on the (MQ) Business Service configuration.
messagedetail381904=A non Text or Bytes message was received by MQ proxy service or as a response to MQ business service. OSB MQ transport only supports Text and Bytes messages.
action381904=Make sure only MQ Text or Bytes messages are being sent to OSB JMS proxy or business services.
messagedetail381905=In the configuration for the MQ proxy service the request and response URIs are the same. Such configuration is not legal as it will most likely result in an infinite loop and request/response processing.
action381905=Make sure that request and response URIs have different values in MQ proxy service configuration
messagedetail381906=Two or more MQ proxy services are using the same URI. The operation cannot be completed because only a single MQ proxy is allowed to receive messages from a given MQ destination.
action381906=Make sure that the given MQ proxy is the only one that is configured with the URI in question.
messagedetail381907=One or more of the URIs configured for MQ service is not in the format expected by OSB. The expected format is mq://host:port?conn=MyOSBProject/MyMQConnectionResource
action381907=Make sure that the URI string conforms to the expected format
messagedetail381908=Failure when trying to lookup MQ Connection Resource specified in the URI of the service.
cause381908=The MQ connection resource specified in the URI may not exist.
action381908=Please ensure that the MQ connection resource specified in the URI exists.
messagedetail381909=The configuration of the MQ service was not compatible with the declared service binding type. For example, a messaging service with non-'None' response type has to have a response destination configured in MQ transport configuration.
action381909=Make sure that the MQ transport configuration of the service is consistent with declared service binding type.
messagedetail381910=This is an informational message to alert the user that an empty response payload is being sent as a response to MQ proxy with response
action381910=If this is expected behavior, no action is required. Otherwise one can use various pipeline actions to examine and set the body of the response message to be sent.
messagedetail381911=Service endpoint could not be activated due to an unexpected exception. There may be an error message that points to the cause of the problem.
action381911=Error message may point to the cause of the problem.
messagedetail381912=Service endpoint could not be resumed due to an unexpected exception. There may be an error message that points to the cause of the problem.
action381912=Error message may point to the cause of the problem.
messagedetail381913=A fatal error has occured when trying to poll the MQ queue specified in the URI of the service.
action381913=The error message may point to the cause of the problem.
messagedetail381914=This error will occur if the MQ native library (com.ibm.mq.jar) is missing on the classpath.
cause381914=This error will occur if the MQ native library (com.ibm.mq.jar) is missing on the classpath.
action381914=Please add the MQ library (com.ibm.mq.jar) to the classpath
messagedetail381915=A fatal error has occured when trying to poll the MQ queue specified in the response URI of the service.
action381915=The error message may point to the cause of the problem.
messagedetail381916=An error has occured when trying to connect to the MQ server; please check the MQ reason code associated with the error for more details
action381916=Please check the MQ reason code associated with the error for more details
messagedetail381917=An error has occured when trying the deploy the MQ transport.
action381917=The error message may contain more details regarding the cause of the problem.
messagedetail381918=While invoking a MQ business service, a response to a MQ request did not arrive before specified timeout expired.
action381918=Check that back-end MQ business service is functioning properly and increase the timeout value if necessary
action381919=Make sure that the MQ connection resource referenced in the URI exists.
messagedetail381920=In the configuration for the MQ business service the Unrecognized Response URI and Response URI are the same. Such configuration is not legal as it will most likely result in an infinite loop and request/response processing.
action381920=Make sure that Unrecognized Response URI and Response URI have different values in MQ business service configuration
messagedetail381921=OSB could not connect to the configured queue on MQ Server.
action381921=Please check if the queue exists on the configured MQ Server.
messagedetail381922=OSB could not send message because queue in not available.
action381922=Please check if the queue exists on the configured MQ Server.
messagedetail381923=Some error occured while end points are being purged.
action381924=For using MQ Transport, please put MQ library in the classpath
