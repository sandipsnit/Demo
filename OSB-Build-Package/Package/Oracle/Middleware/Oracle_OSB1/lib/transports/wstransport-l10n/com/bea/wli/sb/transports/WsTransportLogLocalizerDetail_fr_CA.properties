messagedetail381401=An unexpected general purpose exception has occurred in OSB WS transport. There should be an error message that points to the cause of the problem.
action381401=Contact technical support.
messagedetail381403=No error queue destination is configured for this business service. If the failed messages to be put into the desired queue, please configure the error queue destination in the business service.
messagedetail381404=This endpoint's policy requires HTTPS access. All URLs in this endpoint must use the HTTPS protocol
action381404=Edit the endpoint URLs to make sure all URLs use the HTTPS protocol
messagedetail381405=An error had occured while registering a new WS proxy service: The URI configured for this proxy service "/" is already used by internal OSB Kernel application.
action381405=Check the transport configuration for WS proxy service and make sure that a different unique value is used for the URI of this proxy.
messagedetail381406=An error had occured while registering a new WS proxy service: The URI configured for this proxy service is an absolute URI. Only relative URIs are supported for WS proxy services.
action381406=Check the transport configuration for WS proxy service and make sure that only a relative URI (e.g. "/foo") is used.
messagedetail381407=An error had occured while registering a new WS proxy service: The URI configured for this proxy service is already used by another WS proxy service or HTTP proxy service. Each WS proxy service has to have a unique URI.
action381407=Check the transport configuration for WS proxy service and make sure that unique value for the URI is used.
messagedetail381408=WS business service should have absolute URIs.
action381408=Change the WS business service configuration and make sure that all the URIs should be absolute.
messagedetail381409=An error occurred while registering new WS business service: WS business services can only have http and https schemes.
action381409=Change the scheme of the WS business service to http or https.
messagedetail381410=An HTTPS BASIC authentication policy requires the endpoint to send a username/password when connecting to the back-end service. A service account specifies how to get the username/password and allows the endpoint to get the username/password. This endpoint is configured for outbound HTTPS BASIC authentication but the service account reference is null.
action381410=Configure a service account reference in the endpoint configuration page.
messagedetail381411=While invoking a WS business service, a response to a WS request did not arrive in before the specified response timeout occurred.
action381411=Check that WS business service or the target webservice is functioning properly and increase the response timeout value if necessary.
messagedetail381412=Reliable delivery failure has occurred while sending the message to the target reliable webservice. This failure might be because of Sequence timeout, inactivity timeout, authentication/authorization failures or bad certificate errors etc.
action381412=Check that WS business service or the target webservice is functioning properly.
messagedetail381413=WS proxy services should not have an ending '/' in URI.
action381413=Remove the ending '/' in the URI of the WS proxy service.
messagedetail381414=WS transport proxy services which require username/password (i.e. BASIC) authentication cannot be invoked from another proxy or from the test console.
action381414=Check the message flow configuration and make sure there are no proxy-to-proxy routes where the target proxy service is a WS transport endpoint with BASIC authentication. Also, whenever using the test console to test such a WS transport proxy, make sure you set the "direct call" check-box to true.
messagedetail381415=An identity asserter with X.509 token support enabled is required whenever the ws-policy requires CLIENT-CERT authentication
action381415=Enable X.509 identity assertion in your Identity Assertion provider in the security realm pages of the WebLogic Server console
messagedetail381416=An identity asserter with X.509 token support enabled and username-mapper plugin enabled is required whenever the ws-policy requires CLIENT-CERT authentication (this is required to support 2-way SSL)
action381416=Configure the username-mapper fields of the Default Identity Assertion provider in the security realm pages of the WebLogic Server console
messagedetail381417=Typically, when a WS transport proxy is configured with client-certificate-required policy and is deployed in a cluster, the managed servers must be configured with "Client Cert Proxy Enabled". This is so that the managed servers will honor the certificate in the "WL-Proxy-Client-Cert" HTTP header. Make sure to read the section on SSL configuration in WebLogic Server documentation when using this feature.
action381417=Set "Client Cert Proxy Enabled" to true in the WLS console. This can be done at the cluster level or individually for each managed server in the cluster. Make sure to read the section on SSL configuration in WebLogic Server documentation when using this feature. Use a weblogic.security.net.ConnectionFilter to ensure that this WebLogic Server instance accepts connections only from the machine on which the proxy-server plugin is running, otherwise you will create a security vulnerability because the WL-Proxy-Client-Cert header can be spoofed.
messagedetail381418=There was an unexpected error while processing an inbound message by specified WS proxy service.
action381418=Contact technical support.
messagedetail381419=An error had occured while registering a new WS business service: One of the URLs configured for the business service is invalid. According to RFC 2616, HTTP urls must start with http:// and have a hostname.
action381419=Check the transport configuration for WS business service and make sure that a valid URL is being entered.
messagedetail381420=\"Synchronous\" property in WS transport configuration is upgraded to \"Same Transaction For Response\" in service configuration.
messagedetail381421=Error Queue Configuration is upgraded.
messagedetail381422=Sending the failed request message to error queue is failed for service.
cause381422=Error queue configured for the service may not be available or it may not be accepting the messages from OSB as the security credentials do not match.
action381422=Make sure configured error queue is available and provide right credentials to the service.
