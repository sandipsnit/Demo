    found on Oracle's Global Trade Compliance web site located at
    <a href="http://www.oracle.com/products/export/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/products/export/index.html</a>.
    You agree that neither the programs
    nor any direct product thereof will be exported, directly, or indirectly, in violation of
    these laws, or will be used for any purpose prohibited by these laws including, without
    limitation, nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons proliferation.</p>

    <p><b>Disclaimer of Warranty and Exclusive Remedies</b></p>

    <p>THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.  WE FURTHER DISCLAIM ALL
    WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.</p>

    <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, INCURRED
    BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES HEREUNDER
    SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS (U.S. $1,000).</p>

    <p><b>No Technical Support</b></p>

    <p>Our technical support organization will not provide technical support, phone support, or
    updates to you for the programs licensed under this agreement.</p>

    <p><b>Restricted Rights</b></p>

    <p>If you distribute a license to the United States government, the programs, including
    documentation, shall be considered commercial computer software and you will place a legend,
    in addition to applicable copyright notices, on the documentation, and on the media label,
    substantially similar to the following:</p>

    <p>NOTICE OF RESTRICTED RIGHTS</p>

    <p>"Programs delivered subject to the DOD FAR Supplement are 'commercial computer software'
    and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including documentation, shall be
    subject to the licensing restrictions set forth in the applicable Oracle license agreement.
    Otherwise, programs delivered subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations are 'restricted
    computer software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including
    documentation, shall be subject to the restrictions in FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer
    Software-Restricted Rights (June 1987).  Oracle USA, Inc., 500 Oracle Parkway, Redwood City,
    CA  94065."</p>

    <p><b>End of Agreement</b></p>

    <p>You may terminate this agreement by destroying all copies of the programs.  We have the
    right to terminate your right to use the programs if you fail to comply with any of the
    terms of this agreement, in which case you shall destroy all copies of the programs.</p>

    <p><b>Relationship Between the Parties</b></p>

    <p>The relationship between you and us is that of licensee/licensor.  Neither party will
    represent that it has any authority to assume or create any obligation, express or implied,
    on behalf of the other party, nor to represent the other party as agent, employee, franchisee,
    or in any other capacity.  Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to limit either
    party's right to independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar
    to the other party's products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not
    included in such software.</p>

    <p><b>Open Source</b></p>

    <p>"Open Source" software - software available without charge for use, modification and
    distribution - is often licensed under terms that require the user to make the user's
    modifications to the Open Source software or any software that the user 'combines' with
    the Open Source software freely available in source code form.  If you use Open Source
    software in conjunction with the programs, you must ensure that your use does not:  (i)
    create, or purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the Oracle programs; or
    (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under
    our intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Oracle.  For example, you may not
    develop a software program using an Oracle program and an Open Source program where such
    use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the Oracle program and the
    Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) if the Open Source program
    is licensed under a license that requires any "modifications" be made freely available.
    You also may not combine the Oracle program with programs licensed under the GNU General
    Public License ("GPL") in any manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted
    to cause, the Oracle program, or any modifications thereto, to become subject to the terms
    of the GPL.</p>

    <p><b>Entire Agreement</b></p>

    <p>You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the programs and licenses,
    and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations.
    If any term of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
    provisions will remain effective.</p>
