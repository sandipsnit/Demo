-- ** THIS SCRIPT HAS BEEN PURPOSEFULLY EMPTIED OUT. **
-- 
-- This script will no longer be required. The new Fusion Database Installs
-- will have the S_ROW_ID_SEQ database sequence created automatically during
-- installation. The S_ROW_ID_SEQ will also be periodically be monitored by
-- a scheduled job and will be updated with new keys when it runs low on keys
-- 
-- In addition, the procedure UNIQUE_ID_MGT.cre_or_upd_uid_seq can be used to
-- manually create the S_ROW_ID_SEQ if it does not exist. The UNIQUE_ID_MGT
-- package will also be available as part of the Fusion Database Installation
--
-- The S_ROW_SEQ is only intended to be used by PL/SQL Application code and is
-- not expected to be used by Middle Tier Application Developers.
