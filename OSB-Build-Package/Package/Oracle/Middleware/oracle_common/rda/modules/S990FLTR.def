=head1 NAME

S990FLTR - Control Report Content Filtering

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Adds filter functionality to RDA, which can mask sensitive data like host,
domain, group and user names, IP addresses, LDAP domain components, and
network masks.

You can activate the filter by adding the C<Security> profile to your
profile. For instance,

  <rda> -vdSCRP -p DB10g-Security

RDA offers a default filter configuration based on the system configuration
but end-users can create their own filter or they can customize the existing
default filter.

When the setup file exists already, enable the filter with the following
command:

  <rda> -X Filter enable

If the filter configuration is not performed, then default rules are created.

The filter has a status flag (enabled or disabled), an ordered list of rule
sets, limits, and substitution formats. When the filter is enabled, RDA applies
each rule, in the specified order listed, to each generated report.

Each rule set has one or more matching patterns, possible matching options, a
substitution format, and a replacement string, which tells RDA what strings
to find in the output and how to substitute them.

The syntax for the filter commands is as follows:

  <rda> -X Filter <commands> <arg1> ...

=head1 FILTER MANAGEMENT COMMANDS

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter add set E<lt>nameE<gt> [E<lt>descriptionE<gt>]

Adds a rule set.

=over 4

=item *

If the rule set already exists, then RDA moves the rule set to the end of the
rule set list and resets the rule set description if present.

=item *

RDA adds a nonexisting rule set to the end of the rule set list with a
description if present. If the description is not present, then the rule set
name is taken as the description.

=back

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter add pattern E<lt>nameE<gt> E<lt>patternE<gt>

Adds an extra pattern to an existing rule set.

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter add format E<lt>nameE<gt> E<lt>substitutionE<gt>

Adds a new substitution format to the filter.

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter -f clear

Clears all filtering, which means that filtering is disabled and that the whole
filter definition is removed.

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter delete format E<lt>nameE<gt>

Deletes the substitution format. This works for user-defined substitution
formats only.

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter delete pattern E<lt>nameE<gt> E<lt>offsetE<gt>

Deletes a matching pattern from a rule set. Patterns are referenced by their
offset (cf. the C<list set> command).

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter delete set E<lt>nameE<gt>

Deletes a rule set from the list of rule sets.

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter disable

Disables the filtering.

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter enable

Enables the filtering. When there is no existing rule set list, it generates
the default filter configuration based on the system configuration also.

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter export

Prints out the entire current filter configuration. The output is a series of
commands, which can be issued again to recreate the current filter (or parts of
it) into another RDA setup.

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter list formats

Prints all internal and user-defined substitution formats.

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter list set [E<lt>nameE<gt>]

Displays the specified rule set and its component. When the name is omitted,
all rule sets are reported.

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter list sets

Prints the ordered rule set list.

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter -f reset

Restores the default filter configuration.

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter set format E<lt>setE<gt> E<lt>formatE<gt>

Specifies a format for this rule set.

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter set options E<lt>setE<gt> E<lt>optionsE<gt>

Defines pattern-matching options. Use C<i> to ignore case.

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter set string E<lt>setE<gt> E<lt>stringE<gt>

Sets the replacement string for this rule set.

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter set gid [E<lt>minE<gt>]

Defines the minimum group identifier value to consider when generating default
filtering rules for groups for UNIX. When no argument is given, it resets it to
the default value (101).

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter set uid [E<lt>minE<gt>]

Defines the minimum user identifier value to consider when generating default
filtering rules for users for UNIX. When no argument is given, it resets it to
the default value (101).

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter [-d] test

Tests the rules for a correct syntax. When the B<-d> option is used, the rules
are printed to standard output.

=head1 AUTOMATIC FILTERING

When RDA detects the F<.filter> file for UNIX, the F<filter.win> file for
Windows, or the F<filter.vms> for VMS in the work directory or in the software
top directory during the generation of a new setup file, it loads the filter
definition contained in that file.

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter save

Saves the current filter definition in a file located in the work directory.
The file is F<.filter> for UNIX, F<filter.win> for Windows, or F<filter.vms>
for VMS. It does not write the file if the filter is disabled.

=head2 E<lt>rdaE<gt> -X Filter remove

Removes any filter file from the work directory. The file is F<.filter> on
UNIX, F<filter.win> for Windows, or F<filter.vms> for VMS.
