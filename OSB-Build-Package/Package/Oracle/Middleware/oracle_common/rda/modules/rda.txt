=== No sqlplus ===
 SQL*Plus is required for connecting to the database.

 Please do one of the following:

    -  Interrupt this script, solve the problem, and next re-run rda; or
    -  Hit 'Enter' to continue this script without gathering information from the database.

 If you choose to continue without database connection, some information will be missing and Oracle Support may request that rda be re-run.

=== No connection ===
 The database to be analyzed (${ORACLE_SID}) does not appear to be accessible.

 Please do one of the following:

    -  If the database is not started, start it in another session, then press 'Enter' to continue this script after the database has been started;
    -  Interrupt this script, start the database or solve the connection problem, and next re-run rda; or
    -  Hit 'Enter' to continue this script without gathering information from the database.

=== Start/Windows ===

 The data collection requires an initial setup to determine which information should be collected. To make the setup, use the same command used so far:

    rda.cmd -S
 or
    perl rda.pl -S

 Selective data collection is also possible. For more details, the command usage can be displayed by specifying the -h option, or complete manual page with the -M option.

 rda.cmd and rda.pl must be used from the command line.

=== Start ===

 The data collection requires an initial setup to determine which information should be collected. To make the setup, use the same command used so far:

    ./rda.pl -S
 or
    ./rda.sh -S

 Using the dot ensures you execute RDA from the local directory.

 Selective data collection is also possible. For more details, the command usage can be displayed by specifying the -h option, or complete manual page with the -M option.

=== Setup/Windows ===

 At this point, it should be possible to collect the diagnostic information. sqlplus should connect to the database with the userid specified during the setup.

 With the same command used so far, start the data collection:

    rda.cmd [-v]
 or
    perl rda.pl [-v]

 The -v option is optional. It allows to see the collection progression.

 Once it has completed, the results will be packaged for sending it to Oracle Support Services, if this file was generated to assist in resolving a Service Request.

 Selective data collection is also possible. For more details, the command usage can be displayed by specifying the -h option, or complete manual page with the -M option.

=== Setup/VMS ===

 At this point, it should be possible to collect the diagnostic information. sqlplus should connect to the database with the userid specified during the setup.

 With the same command used so far, start the data collection:

    @RDA "-v"

 The "-v" option is optional. It allows to see the collection progression.
