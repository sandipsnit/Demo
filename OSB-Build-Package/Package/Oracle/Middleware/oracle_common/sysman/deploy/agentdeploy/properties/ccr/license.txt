ORACLE CONNECTION TOOLS AGREEMENT 

Introduction 
------------ 

Customer (hereafter "Customer" or "you") agrees to the following conditions 
regarding the use of Oracle's live connection tools, including the Oracle 
project currently known as Oracle Configuration Manager, and Remote Diagnostic Agent,
that you have either downloaded from Oracle's technical support web site or 
which you received from Oracle, and the related services that Oracle provides 
in connection with those tools (collectively, the "Tools"). The individual 
entering into this agreement certifies that he/she has authority to enter into
this agreement on Customer's behalf. 

These terms supplement the terms of your licensing or distribution agreement 
with Oracle and the terms of Oracle's Technical Support Policies. In the event
of a conflict between your licensing or distribution agreement or the 
Technical Support Policies and the following terms, the relevant terms below 
will control your use of the Tools. 
 

Description of Tools: What Data is Collected and How it is Stored and Used 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The Tools are designed to collect technical information regarding the 
configuration of your Oracle environment and the performance of the Oracle 
programs (e.g., hardware, database, application server and applications 
configuration metrics; error and diagnostic trace files) (collectively, 
"Configuration Data") and forward the Configuration Data to Oracle. Additional
Configuration Data examples are available upon request. The documentation that
accompanies each Tool includes installation and configuration instructions, as
well as a description of the method used to forward Configuration Data to 
Oracle. The Tools will not access, collect or store any personally 
identifiable information (with the exception of a local contact name in case 
of problems with the transmission of Configuration Data) or business data 
files residing in your production environment. 

Once Configuration Data is sent to Oracle, it is stored in password-protected
repositories and is used to assist in resolving Service Requests and other 
issues with the programs, to provide recommendations regarding configuration 
and/or deployment of the programs, and for product and service planning 
purposes. In addition, because the information provided will be current, it 
may also be used to assist you in managing your Oracle product portfolio, for 
license and services compliance and to enable Oracle to improve upon and/or 
recommend new product and service offerings to you. Oracle will comply with 
its Privacy Policy in effect as services are performed, which is available at 
www.oracle.com/html/privacy.html. 


License 
-------

You agree that the Tools will be used solely in support of your authorized use
of the Oracle Programs for which you hold a supported license from Oracle. 
Your right to use the Tools will terminate upon termination of those licenses 
or upon termination or expiration of Software Update License & Support. 
Unless specifically provided in your licensing or distribution agreement with
Oracle, the Tools may not be used to offer or provide services for or to third
parties and may not be shared with or accessed by third parties. 


WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS 
--------------------------

THE TOOLS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RELEVANT SERVICES WARRANTIES AND EXCLUSIVE 
REMEDIES STATED IN THE LICENSING OR DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU 
AND ORACLE. ORACLE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE TOOLS ARE THE MOST RECENT 
VERSION(S), THAT THE TOOLS ARE ERROR FREE, THAT THE TOOLS WILL WORK WITHOUT 
INTERRUPTION, OR THAT THE TOOLS ARE COMPLETELY SECURE. ORACLE DOES NOT 
PROVIDE ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED IN LAW, 

INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE TOOLS ARE NOT PROGRAMS UNDER THE TERMS OF YOUR 
LICENSE OR DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT(S) WITH ORACLE. 

 
Export Compliance 
----------------- 

You agree that you will comply with all United States export laws and that 
none of the Tools will be exported, directly or indirectly, in violation of 
such laws.
