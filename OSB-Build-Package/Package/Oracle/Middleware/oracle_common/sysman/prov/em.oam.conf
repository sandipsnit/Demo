# This is a configuration file, to be used with the OAM Config Tool, for 
# configuring policies in OAM in order to facilitate Single Sign On.
#
# Protected URIs:-
#  A Protected URI (resource) implies that an user must be authenticated 
# before he could access that resource. Upon accessing a protected uri, the 
# user would be redirected to the OAM login page for authentication. 
# Subsequently, upon successful authentication, he would be redirected to the 
# original requested resource.
#
# Public URIs:-
#  A Public URI (resource), on the contrary, implies that a user be allowed 
# access to that resource without authentication.
#
# This file essentially contains a list of protected and public URIs belonging 
# to an Application.
#
# Please refer to the documentation of OAM Config Tool for anything related to
# the OAM Config tool's usage and the documentation of OAM for anything 
# related to OAM in general.

# File format description 
##########################
# 1. Any line beginning with '#' is considered a comment and would be ignored
# 2. Likewise any empty line or any line beginning with ' ' (space) would be 
#    ignored
# 3. All the Protected URIs must be listed followed by the key-word: 
#    "protected_uris".
# 4. All the Public URIs must be listed followed by the key-word: "public_uris"
#
#    Note that Public URIs are optional. But you need to have at least one 
#    Protected URI listed
#
##########################
# Basic configuration
##########################
# 1. One Policy domain would be created in OAM based on the parameter 
#    "app_domain", passed to the OAM Config Tool, during its execution.
#
# 2. This Policy domain would be configured with an Authentication scheme 
#    that would require the user to authenticate.
#
# 3. All the URIs listed following the key-word, "protected_uris" would be 
#    created as "resources" in OAM i.e. all these would be protected by the 
#    default authentication scheme configured in OAM.
#
# 4. All the URIs listed following the key-word, "public_uris" would be 
#    added to a default public policy in OAM. This policy would be configured
#    with an Anonymous Authentication Scheme, allowing access to everyone.
#
##########################
# Advanced configuration
##########################
# Note that under this configuration, the configuration listed as part of 
# 'Basic configuration' are also done in addition to the below.
#
# The OAM Config Tool can also be used to configure user defined Policies in 
# OAM. The policies could be configured to be protected with a default
# authentication scheme (protected) or with an anonymous authentication scheme
# (public).
#
# Format for specifying Protected and Public Policies are the same, except that
# the Protected Policies must be listed under "protected_uris" whereas the 
# Public Policies must be listed under "public_uris"
#
# 1. To specify the name of a Policy:
#    - Line without leading "/" implies the name of the policy. 
#    - Only for public policy, if no name is specified then by default, the 
#      name used is "public_<app_domain>". Note that all protected policies 
#      must have a name. 
#
# 2. To specify a URL Pattern for a policy: 
#    - List the URL Pattern next to the resource separated by one or more spaces
#    - List the URL pattern for every resource in that policy
#    For example:
#        policy for allowing access to all images/scripts under /uri1 and /uri2
#        /uri1   /.../{*.js,*.gif}
#        /uri2   /.../{*.js,*.gif}
#    
# 3. To specify a Query String for a policy:
#    - List the resource followed by the querystring (separated by '?') 
#    - List the Query String for every resource in that policy
#    For example:
#        public policy with query string
#        /uri3?{SoapImpl*,WSDL,privateWSDL}
#        /uri4?{SoapImpl*,WSDL,privateWSDL}
