<h1>Configure the Administration Server</h1>
<p>The Administration Server is the central point from which you manage your domain. You can access the Administration Server by using the URL <span class="code">protocol://listen-address:listen-port</span>. The protocol can be any of the following: <span class="code">t3</span>, <span class="code">t3s</span>, <span class="code">http</span>, <span class="code">https</span>.</p>
<p>Use this screen to configure or change the following Administration Server settings. Required fields are indicated by an asterisk (*).</p>
<table>
 <tr>
 <th>Field</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
 <tr>
 <td><strong>*Name</strong></td>
    <td>The default name is AdminServer. Valid server names are a string of characters (alphabetic and numeric).
<p class="list_para">Each server instance in the production environment must have a unique name, regardless of the domain or cluster in which it resides, and regardless of whether it is an administration server or a managed server. In addition, the name of the administration server must be unique among all component names within the domain.</p>
      <p class="list_para"><strong>Note</strong>: This value is specified for identification purposes only. It is not used as part of the URL for applications that are deployed on the server. The server name is displayed in the WebLogic Server administration console. In addition, if you use WebLogic Server command-line utilities or APIs, you must specify this name to identify the server. </p></td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
 <td><strong>*Listen address </strong></td>
    <td>From the drop-down list, select a value for the listen address.<p class="list_para">If you select <strong>localhost</strong> as the listen address for a server instance, remote processes cannot connect to that server instance. Only processes on the machine that hosts the server instance can connect to the server instance. If the server instance must be accessible as a local host (for example, if you create administrative scripts that connect to the local host)  and  also be accessible to remote processes, select <strong>All Local Addresses</strong>. The server instance determines the address of the machine and listens on it.</p>

 <td><strong>Listen port </strong></td>
    <td>Enter a valid value for the listen port to be used for regular, nonsecure requests (through protocols such as HTTP and T3).
      <p class="list_para">The default value is 7001 for the administration server. If you leave this field blank, the default value is used. </p>
      <p class="list_para">The valid listen port range is from 1 to 65534.</p>

      <p class="list_para">The valid listen port range is from 1 to 65535.</p>
    <p class="list_para"><strong>Note</strong>: By default, a server instance uses demonstration certificates to authenticate requests from a secure port. In a production environment, you must configure SSL to use certificates from a certificate authority.</p></td>

<H2><a name="listen_address">Specifying the Listen Address</a></h2>
<p>This section provides guidelines for specifying the listen address for the Administration Server. These guidelines also apply to all Managed Servers.</p>
<table>
 <tr>
 <th>Listen Address Type</th>
    <th>Behavior</th>
  </tr>
 <tr>
 <td><strong>All Local Addresses or a DNS name</strong></td>
    <td>On multi-homed Windows machines, a server instance binds to all available IP addresses.</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
 <td><strong>An IP address or a DNS name</strong></td>
    <td><ul>
<li>To connect to the server instance, processes can specify either the IP address or the corresponding DNS name.</li>
<li>Processes that specify localhost fail to connect.</li>
<li>You must update existing processes that use localhost to connect to the server instance.</li>
<li>For connections that specify the IP address for the listen address and a secured port for the listen port, host name verification must be disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To resolve a DNS name to an IP address, WebLogic Server must be able to contact an appropriate DNS server or obtain the IP address mapping locally. Therefore, if you specify a DNS name for the listen address, you must either leave a port open long enough for the WebLogic Server instance to connect to a DNS server and cache its mapping or you must specify the IP address mapping in a local file. If you specify an IP address for the listen address, and a client request then specifies a DNS name, WebLogic Server attempts to resolve the DNS name. If it cannot access DNS name mapping, the request fails.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>localhost</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li>Processes must specify localhost to connect to the server instance.</li>
<li>Only processes that reside on the machine that hosts the server instance (local processes) can connect to the server instance.</li>
</ul></td>
  </tr>

<h2><a name=listen_port>Specifying the Listen Port</h2>
<p>Note the following guidelines when specifying the listen port for the Administration Server. These guidelines also apply to Managed Servers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Although you can specify any valid port number, if you specify port 80, you can omit the port number from the HTTP request used to access resources over HTTP. For example, if you define port 80 as the listen port, you can use the URL <span class="code>http://hostname/myfile.html</span> instead of <span class="code>http://hostname:portnumber/myfile.html</span>.</li>
<li>On some operating systems, port 80 can be accessed only by processes run under a privileged user or group ID. In this case, you can assign the server instance to a UNIX machine on which a post-bind UID or GID is defined.</li>
