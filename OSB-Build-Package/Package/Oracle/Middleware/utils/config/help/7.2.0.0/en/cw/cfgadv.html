<h1>Select Advanced Configuration</h1>
<p>Select all categories (if any) for which you want to perform advanced configuration. For each category you select, the appropriate configuration screen is displayed to allow you to perform advanced configuration. If you do not select any items on this screen, the Configuration Summary screen is displayed next.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The categories that are listed on this screen depend on the resources defined in the templates you selected for the domain.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>Administration Server</strong> and <strong>RDBMS Security Store</strong> options are not available when you are extending a domain. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Administration Server</strong>
<br>Select this option to modify Administration Server settings such as server name, listen address, listen port, and SSL settings.</li>
<li><strong>JMS Distributed Destination</strong>
<br>By default, JMS distributed destinations are automatically converted to Weighted Distributed Destinations (WDD). Select this option to change a JMS distributed destination to a Unified Distributed Destination (UDD).</li>
<li>Managed Servers, Clusters, and Machines<br>
Select this option to
<ul>
<li>Add Managed Servers, clusters, or machines to the domain</li>
<li>Delete an existing Managed Server, cluster, or machine</li>

</ul>
<p>For each advanced configuration option that you select in this screen, the wizard displays additional screens later, in which you can define the relevant advanced configuration settings. </p>
<p>Select the required check boxes depending on the advanced configuration that you want to perform, and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
