<h1>Configure Clusters</h1>
<p>Use this screen to add, configure, and delete clusters. </p>
<p>A cluster is a group of WebLogic Server instances that work together to provide scalability and high-availability for applications. By creating clusters, you can group managed servers such that they operate as a single unit for hosting applications and resources.</p>
<ol>
<li> Review the current cluster configuration. Default values might vary based on the domain source you have selected.
  <p class="list_para"><strong>Note</strong>: The wizard provides two views: a concise tabular view of all the clusters, and an individual view of each cluster with  each server represented by a tab. To toggle the view mode between the table and tab views, click <strong>Switch Display</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Add or delete clusters, or change the settings for existing clusters, as required for your domain.
<p class="list_para">The following table describes the fields in this screen. The fields marked with an asterisk (*) are mandatory fields.</p>
    <table>
 <tr>
 <th>Field</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
 <tr>
 <td><strong>Name*</strong></td>
        <td>Enter a valid name for the cluster.
        <p class="list_para">The name of the cluster must be unique among all component names within the domain. The default value in this field is <span class="code">new_Cluster_n</span>, where <span class="code">n</span> is a numeric value that is used to differentiate among all the default cluster names; the value of <span class="code">n</span> for the first cluster is 1. The value is incremented by 1 for each cluster that you add.</p></td>
      </tr>
 <tr>
 <td><strong>Cluster messaging mode</strong></td>
        <td>Select unicast or multicast messaging mode.
        </td>
      </tr>
 <tr>
 <td><strong>Multicast address</strong></td>
        <td>This field is enabled only if you select the multicast  messaging mode.
          <p class="list_para">Enter the multicast address for the cluster. This address is used by cluster members to communicate with each other. The default value is <span class="code">239.192.0.0</span>. The valid multicast address range is from <span class="code">224.0.0.1</span> to <span class="code">239.255.255.255</span>.</p></td>
      </tr>
 <tr>
 <td><strong>Multicast port</strong></td>
        <td>This field is enabled only if you select the multicast  messaging mode.
        <p class="list_para">Enter the multicast port for the cluster. The multicast port is used by cluster members to communicate with each other. The default value is <span class="code">7001</span>.</p></td>
      </tr>
 <tr>
 <td><strong>Cluster address</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the addresses to identify the managed servers in the cluster. A cluster address can be one of the following:
		<ul>
<li> Comma-separated list of IP addresses or DNS names and ports (for example: dns_name:port, dns_name:port)</li>
        <li>DNS name that maps to multiple IP addresses</li>
        <li>localhost, DNS name, or IP address if the listen address of all managed servers is listening to the same address with unique port numbers</li>
		</ul>
        <p class="list_para">The cluster address is used in entity and stateless EJBs to construct the host name portion of URLs. If the cluster address is not set, EJB handles might not work properly.</p></td>
      </tr>
 </table>
  </li>
  <li>After making the required selections and entries, click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To delete a cluster, select the server and click <strong>Delete</strong>. When you delete a cluster, you do not delete the servers assigned to it; the servers are merely removed from the cluster and can then be added to another cluster. You can delete only one cluster at a time.</p>

<p>To add a cluster, click <strong>Add</strong> and configure the settings for the new cluster. The default name for a new cluster is <span class="code">new_Cluster_n</span>, where <span class="code">n</span> starts at <span class="code">1</span> and increments for each new cluster you add. To change the default, type the desired name in the Name column</p>
<p>To switch the display from the default tabular format to a tabbed format (with one tab for each cluster), click <strong>Switch Display</strong>. Click <strong>Switch Display</strong> again to return to tabular format.</p>
