<h1>Configure JDBC Data Source</h1>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>A JDBC data source contains a pool of database connections that are created when the data source instance is created&mdash;when it is deployed or targeted, or at server startup. Applications look up a data source on the JNDI tree, and then request a connection. When the applications no longer need the connections, they return the connections to the connection pool in the data source.</p>
<p>Use this screen to configure the JDBC data sources defined in your domain source.</p>
<p>The JDBC data sources associated with the products for which you are creating the domain are listed in the lower half of the screen.</p>
<p>To configure one or more of the data sources as GridLink RAC data sources, select the check box adjacent to the name of the data source, and select the <strong>Configure selected data sources as GridLink data sources in the next panel</strong> check box. This option is available only if your domain or extension template includes a definition for a GridLink RAC data source. When you click <span class="gui-object-action">Next</span>, the <a href="cfggridlinkds.html">Configure GridLink RAC Data Sources</a> screen is displayed.</p>
<p>To configure one or more of the data sources as Oracle RAC multi data sources, select the check box adjacent to the name of the required schema, and select the <strong>Configure selected data sources as RAC multi data sources in the next panel</strong> check box. This option is available only if your existing domain or the extension template you are using includes a definition for an Oracle RAC multi data source. When you click <strong>Next</strong>, the <a href="cfgrac.html">Configure Oracle RAC Multi Data Sources</a> screen is displayed.</p>
<p>Select the data source(s) for which you want to specify settings by selecting the check box adjacent to each data source name.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<p>When you select multiple data sources, the text <strong>Varies among data sources</strong> might be displayed in certain fields, indicating that the current values of those fields are different across the selected data sources. If you change the values in such fields, the new values are applied uniformly across the selected data sources.
<p>The default values of data source parameters such as vendor, driver, host name, and port number depend on the values that are specified in the application templates.</p>
<!-- class="inftblnote" --></div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Vendor</strong>&mdash;Select the database vendor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Driver</strong>&mdash;Select the JDBC driver to use to connect to the database. The list includes common JDBC drivers for the selected database vendor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Username</strong>&mdash;Enter the username for connecting to the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Password</strong>&mdash;Enter the password for the specified username.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DBMS/Service</strong>&mdash;Enter a DBMS SID or service name. The value that you enter depends on the driver that you selected.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the name of the Oracle driver that you selected contains the words "for Instance connections," you must enter the SID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the name of the Oracle driver contains the words "for Service connections," you must enter the service name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For information about configuring a DataDirect driver, see the DataDirect documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Host Name</strong>&mdash;Enter the name of the server hosting the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Port</strong>&mdash;Enter the port number to be used to connect to the server.</p>
</li>
