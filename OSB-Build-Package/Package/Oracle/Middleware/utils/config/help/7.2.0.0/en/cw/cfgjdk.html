<title>Configuration Wizard Help: Configure Server Start Mode and JDK</title>

<h1>Configure Server Start Mode and JDK</h1>
<p>On this screen, specify whether you want to run WebLogic in Production mode or Development mode. You also specify the location of the JDK(s) to use in this domain.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the WebLogic domain startup mode.
<ul>
 <li class="list_para"><strong>Development Mode</strong>
<br>In this mode, the security configuration is relatively relaxed, allowing you to autodeploy applications.</li>
    <li class="list_para"><strong>Production Mode</strong><br>
In this mode, the security configuration is relatively stringent, requiring a username and password to deploy applications. Before putting a domain into production, familiarize yourself with procedures for securing a production environment. For more information, see <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/as1111/lookup?id=LOCKD121" target="_blank">Ensuring the Security of Your Production Environment</a> in <i>Securing a Production Environment for Oracle WebLogic Server.</i></li>
	</ul>
    <p class="list_para">The following table provides information to help you select a startup mode that suits your requirements.</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Function</th>
        <th>Development mode</th>
        <th>Production mode</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>SSL</strong></td>
        <td>You can use the demonstration digital certificates and the demonstration keystores provided by the WebLogic Server security services. With these certificates, you can design your application to work within environments secured by SSL. 
<p>For more information, see <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/as1111/lookup?id=SECMG384" target="_blank">Configuring SSL</a> in <i>Securing Oracle WebLogic Server</i>.</p>
</td>
        <td>You must not use the demonstration digital certificates and the demonstration keystores. If you do so, a warning message will be displayed.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Deploying applications</strong></td>
        <td>WebLogic Server instances can deploy and update applications that reside in the <span class="code">domain_name/autodeploy</span> directory automatically.
<p>Oracle recommends that you use this method only in a single-server development environment.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/as1111/lookup?id=DEPGD212" target="_blank">Deploying Applications and Modules with weblogic.deployer</a> in <i>Deploying Applications to Oracle WebLogic Server</i>.</p>
</td>
        <td>The auto-deployment feature is disabled; so, you must use the WebLogic Server administration console, the <span class="code">weblogic.Deployer</span> tool, or the WebLogic Scripting Tool.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Log file rotation</strong></td>
        <td>By default, when you start the WebLogic Server instance, the server automatically renames (rotates) its local server log file as <span class="code">SERVER-NAME.log.n</span>. For the remainder of the server session, messages accumulate in the log file until the file grows to a size of 500 kilobytes.
<p>The default value of the <b>Limit number of retained files</b> setting in Logging Configuration is <span class="code">true</span>. This limits the number of log files that the server instance creates to store old messages.</p>
</td>
        <td>The server rotates the local log file after the size of the file reaches 5000 kilobytes. When the server is configured for production mode, by default, all versions of the log files are kept. Administrators might want to customize the number of log files retained.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>JDBC system resource</strong></td>
        <td>The default capacity is 15 connections.</td>
        <td>The default capacity is 25 connections.</td>

  </li>
  <li>Select the JDK.
 <p class="list_para">In the <strong>JDK Selection</strong> pane, select the JDK for the startup mode that you selected in the <strong>WebLogic Domain Startup Mode</strong> pane. The Configuration Wizard presents a list of the JDKs included in the installer. You can choose one of these JDKs or another JDK that you have installed on your system.</p>
    <p class="list_para"><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
<li> If you select a JDK that is included in the installer, the Configuration Wizard creates server startup scripts to invoke the JDK. If you select a JDK that is not supplied by JDK, the Configuration Wizard does not configure the startup scripts; you must change the startup scripts manually.</li>
      <li>Select only those JDKs that are supported on the platform you are using. The default selection reflects the JDK that best meets the requirements of your environment, based on the platform on which you are installing the domain.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After making the required selections and entries, click the <strong>Next</strong> button in the wizard.</li>
