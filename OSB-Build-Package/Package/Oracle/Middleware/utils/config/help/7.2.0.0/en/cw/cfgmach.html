<h1>Configure Machines</h1>
<p>In a WebLogic domain, the machine definitions identify physical units of hardware and are associated with the WebLogic Server instances that they host.</p>

<p>Use this screen to add or delete machines, or to modify the settings for an existing machine. </p>

<p>Select the <strong>Machine</strong> tab (for Windows) or the UNIX Machine tab (for UNIX).</p>

<p>You might want to create machine definitions in situations such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Administration Server uses the machine definition, with the Node Manager application, to start remote servers.</li>
<li>WebLogic Server uses configured machine names when determining the server in a cluster that is best able to handle certain tasks, such as HTTP session replication. WebLogic Server then delegates those tasks to the identified server.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must configure machines for each product installation that runs a Node Manager process. The machine configuration must include values for the listen address and port number parameters. 
</p>

<p>Each machine has the following configuration settings. Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*).</p>
<ol>
<li> Select the <strong>Machine</strong> tab (for Windows) and <strong>Unix Machine</strong> tab (for UNIX).</li>
  <li>Review the current list of configurations, and add, delete, or change settings as required for your domain.
 The following table describes the fields in this screen. The fields marked with an asterisk (*) are mandatory fields.<p></p>
    <table>
 <tr>
 <th>Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
 <tr>
 <td><strong>Name*</strong></td>
      <td>Enter a valid name for the machine.<p class="list_para">The machine name is used to identify the machine within the WebLogic Server domain; it is not required to match the network name for the machine. The name must be unique among all component names within the domain. The default value in this field is <span class="code">new_[Unix]Machine_n</span>, where <span class="code">n</span> is a numeric value that is used to differentiate among all default machine names; the value of <span class="code">n</span> for the first machine is 1. The value is incremented by 1 for each machine that you add.</p></td>
    </tr>
 <tr>
 <td><strong>Node manager listen address</strong></td>
      <td>Select a value from the list, for the address used by node manager to listen for connection requests.<p class="list_para">By default, the IP addresses defined for the local system and <strong>localhost</strong> are shown in the list. The default value is <strong>localhost</strong>. If you specify an IP address for a machine that hosts the administration server and you need to access the WebLogic Server node manager, then you must disable host name verification.</p>

    </tr>
 <tr>
 <td><strong>Node manager listen port</strong></td>
      <td>Enter a valid value for the listen port used by node manager to listen for connection requests.<p class="list_para">The valid port number range for the listen port of the node manager is from 1 to 65534. The default value is 5556.</p></td>

 <td><strong>Post bind GID enabled</strong></td>
      <td>(UNIX machines only) Select this check box to enable a server running on this machine to bind to a UNIX group ID (GID) after it finishes all privileged startup actions (see the description of the <strong>Post bind GID</strong> field below). By default, this check box is not selected.</td>
    </tr>
 <tr>
 <td><strong>Post bind GID</strong></td>
      <td>(UNIX machines only) Enter a valid UNIX group ID (GID), using which  a server hosted on this machine will run  after it finishes all privileged startup actions. Otherwise, the server continues to run by using the group ID with which it was started. 
        <p class="list_para">For this setting to take effect, you must select the <strong>Post-bind GID enabled</strong> check box. </p></td>
    </tr>
 <tr>
 <td><strong>Post bind UID enabled</strong></td>
      <td>(UNIX machines only) Select this check box to enable a server hosted on this machine to bind to a UNIX user ID (UID) after it finishes all privileged startup actions (see the description of the <strong>Post bind UID</strong> field below). By default, this check box is not selected.</td>
    </tr>
 <tr>
 <td><strong>Post bind UID</strong></td>
      <td>(UNIX machines only) Enter a valid UNIX user ID (UID), using which  a server hosted on this machine will run  after it finishes all privileged startup actions. Otherwise, the server continues to run by using the user ID with which it was started.

<p>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add a new machine. The default name for a new machine is <span class="code">new_[Unix]Machine_n</span>, where <span class="code">n</span> starts at <span class="code">1</span> and increments by 1 for each machine that you add.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Delete</strong> to delete an existing machine.</p>
