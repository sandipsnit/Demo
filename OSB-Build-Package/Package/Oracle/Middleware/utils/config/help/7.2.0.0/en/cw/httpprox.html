<ul>
<li>At least one Managed Server is assigned to a cluster.</li>
<li>At least one Managed Server is not assigned to any cluster.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Create HTTP Proxy</strong> check box against the cluster for which you want to create the HTTP proxy application.

<p class="list_para">A list of the Managed Servers that are not assigned to any cluster is displayed in the <strong>Proxy Server</strong> list.</p></li>
<li>From the <strong>Proxy Server</strong> list, select a Managed Server on which the proxy application must be deployed.
<p class="list_para">A proxy application named <span class="code">OracleProxy4_&lt;clustername&gt;_&lt;servername&gt;</span> is created and deployed in the selected Managed Server.</p>
</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each cluster for which you want to create HTTP proxy applications.</li>
<li>After making the required selections, click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
