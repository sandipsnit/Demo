<h1>Select Domain Source</h1>
<p>Choose whether to generate a domain that is configured automatically to support selected products, or to create a domain based on an existing domain template. Each product in the displayed list is associated with a single domain or extension template (a JAR file) which configures the domain resources needed for that product.</p>
<ol>
<li> Select one of the following options:
 <ul>
<li> <strong>Generate a domain configured automatically to support the following products</strong><br>By default, the <strong>Basic WebLogic Server Domain </strong>option is selected. Select the check boxes that correspond to the other products that you want to include in the domain. If you select a product that is dependent on resources provided by another product or products in the list, those products are also selected automatically.</li>
      <li><strong>Base this domain on an existing template</strong><br>Select this option if you want to create a domain by using an existing domain template. Enter the full path to the template JAR file in the <strong>Template location</strong> field, or click <strong>Browse</strong> to navigate to the directory containing the required template.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After making the required selection, click the <strong>Next</strong> button in the wizard. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  When you click <strong>Next</strong>, if any of the selected products require resources provided by another product that is not selected, a warning dialog box is displayed. Return to the Select Domain Source screen to select the dependency product before proceeding.</p>
