<H1>Target Deployments to Clusters or Servers</H1>
<p>Use this screen to target applications for deployment on servers or clusters.</p>
<p>Applications associated with the product for which you are configuring the domain (for example, SOA) are targeted automatically, to the  Managed Server created for that product or to the cluster to which that Managed Server is assigned. In this screen, you can target applications to additional servers and clusters.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Target</strong> pane, select the cluster or server on which you want to deploy applications.
 <p class="list_para">The name of the selected target is displayed as the title of the right pane.</p></li>
<li>In the right pane, select the check boxes corresponding to the applications that you want to deploy on the selected target.
  <p class="list_para">The applications displayed here vary, depending on the products that you selected in the <strong>Select Domain Source</strong> screen earlier in the wizard.</p>
    <p class="list_para"><strong>Note</strong>: When you select a Managed Server in the <strong>Target</strong> pane, some of the check boxes in the right pane might be disabled, indicating applications that are already  targeted at the cluster that contains the selected Managed Server.</p>
    <p class="list_para">After you select applications, the names of the targeted clusters and servers are displayed in the <strong>Target</strong> column in the right pane.</p>
</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the other clusters and servers, as required.</li>
<li>After making the required selections, click <strong>Next</strong>d.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you extend a domain, if you delete a Managed Server or cluster to which applications are currently targeted, the Configuration Wizard automatically retargets those applications as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If the applications were originally targeted solely to the Managed Server or cluster that you are now deleting (that is, after you delete the Managed Server or cluster, the applications would become untargeted in the modified domain), then the Configuration Wizard automatically retargets the applications to all eligible targets.
<p class="list_para">An eligible target is any cluster or Managed Server that is not defined in the configuration groups specification (config-groups.xml file) of an included template. Servers or clusters that are specified in config-groups.xml are essentially owned by the template and, therefore, are not eligible for automatic targeting.</p>
</li>
<li>If the applications were originally targeted to multiple targets (including Managed Servers, clusters, and the Administration Server), and one of the targeted Managed Servers or clusters is deleted, then, in the extended domain, the Configuration Wizard leaves the remaining target associations intact and does not attempt to retarget the applications.</li>
</ul>
