<H1>Target Services to Servers or Clusters</H1>
<p>Use this screen to target services to the appropriate Managed Servers or clusters.</p>
<p>Services that are associated with the product for which you are configuring the domain (for example, SOA) are targeted automatically, to the  managed server created for that product or to the cluster to which that managed server is assigned. In this screen, you can target services to additional servers and clusters.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Target</strong> pane, select the cluster or server on which you want to deploy services.
  <p class="list_para">The name of the selected target is displayed as the title of the right pane.</p></li>
<li>In the right pane, select the check boxes corresponding to the services that you want to deploy on the selected target.
  <p class="list_para">The services displayed here vary, depending on the products that you selected in the <strong>Select Domain Source</strong> screen earlier in the wizard.</p>
    <p class="list_para">When you select a managed server in the <strong>Target</strong> pane, some of the check boxes in the right pane might be disabled, indicating services that are already targeted at the cluster that contains the selected managed server.</p>
    <p class="list_para">After you select services, the names of the targeted clusters and servers are displayed in the <strong>Target</strong> column in the right pane.</p>
</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the other clusters and servers, as required.</li>
<li>After making the required selections, click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you extend a domain, if you delete a Managed Server or cluster to which services are currently targeted, the Configuration Wizard automatically retargets those services as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the services were originally targeted solely to the Managed Server or cluster that you are now deleting (that is, after you delete the Managed Server or cluster, the services would become untargeted in the modified domain), then the Configuration Wizard automatically retargets the services to all <i>eligible</i> targets.
<p class="list_para">An eligible target is any cluster or Managed Server that is not defined in the configuration groups specification (config-groups.xml file) of an included template. Servers or clusters that are specified in config-groups.xml are essentially owned by the template and, therefore, are not eligible for automatic targeting.</p>
</li>
<li>If the services were originally targeted to multiple targets (including Managed Servers, clusters, and the Administration Server), and one of the targeted Managed Servers or clusters is deleted, then, in the extended domain, the Configuration Wizard leaves the remaining target associations intact and does not attempt to retarget the services.
</li>
</ul>
